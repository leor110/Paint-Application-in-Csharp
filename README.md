Paint Application in C# 

This project is an implementation of a complex hierarchical class system in C#, adhering to the following requirements:

1. The project includes a complex hierarchical system of classes, consisting of no less than 6 classes.

2. The management of classes is accomplished through the use of polymorphism, allowing for dynamic and flexible behavior based on the specific objects involved.

3. The organization of objects is facilitated by utilizing a collection object, which provides a structured and efficient approach to handling multiple instances.

4. The system provides the capability to add, modify, and delete objects, enabling effective manipulation and customization of the class system.

5. The project incorporates event-driven programming techniques, ensuring responsiveness and interactivity based on specific events and triggers.

6. Objects within the system are represented graphically, allowing for a visual understanding and intuitive representation of the relationships and interactions between objects.

7. The state of the object system can be saved and restored using a serialization mechanism, providing the ability to preserve and retrieve the current state of the system.
